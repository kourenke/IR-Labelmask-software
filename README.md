# IR-Labelmask-software

The infrared (IR) small targets often lack texture and color information, and have blurry boundaries, making pixel-level mask annotation labor-intensive and challenging to achieve accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive IR small target mask recovery method based on multi-scale chain growth clustering and single-point supervision. This method significantly reduces labor costs while ensuring mask accuracy.
